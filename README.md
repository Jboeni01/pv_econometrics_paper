# pv_econometrics_paper
Code for tables & plots (summary statistics and estimation results):

   - folder "pv_data" contains necessary data to replicate any plots and tables

   - "plot_figures.R" is the code to replicate any descriptives figures and tables in the paper (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure A2, Table 1, Table A8)

   - "estimates_monthly.R" is the code to replicates regression results (Table 2-6, A9-A12)

Note that the replication is also available on my Github under https://github.com/Jboeni01/pv_econometrics_paper

Please make sure to install all necessary packages before running the replication code and to ensure the data is in the corresponding directory.
